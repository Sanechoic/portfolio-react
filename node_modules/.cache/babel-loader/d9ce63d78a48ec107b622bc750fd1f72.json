The proportion of readings during any given hour that are disruptive is used to estimate the probability of disruption. The disruption is minimal in the small hours of the morning when only a few of the lines are running a night service and the majority of the lines are closed. The disruption rate rises to a peak of roughly 0.3 (30%) at 0900, and falls sharply, evening out in the mid afternoon and decreasing more steadily. A potential inference from this is that the disruptions are generally as a result of “rush-hour” in the morning where frayed tensions and congestion dramatically increase the chance of disruption. This model fits well with existing intuition and thus may not be used directly but can confirm that between 0700 and 1000 are suitable times for an alert window (although the user will be able to adjust this interval).\"\n         col=\"col-12\"\n         align=\"left\"\n         type=\"text\"\n         font=\"15px\"\n         margin=\"20px 120px 100px 84px\"\n        />\n        <SectionOne\n         title=\"BLE Data - Detecting Location\"\n         text=\"There are three main areas where my phone is usually located: the lounge, the attic or the bedroom.
