We will use the beginning of the year to develop our second product, a more robust version of first, to be sold for outdoor and public places (train stations, parks, shopping centres). These sales will be born of existing relationships with Network Rail, and through the borough councils or private entities responsible for a public space. Crucially, we forecast becoming profitable by the end of the second year.\"\n         col=\"col-12\"\n         align=\"left\"\n         type=\"text\"\n         font=\"15px\"\n         margin=\"20px 120px 30px 84px\"\n        />\n        <Text\n         text='Years 3-5'\n         col=\"col-12\"\n         type=\"sectionOne-title\"\n         margin=\"0px 84px 0px 84px\"\n        />\n        <Text\n         text=\"At the beginning of year 3, we start international sales of product one and start employing others to facilitate this.

In year 4 we will begin selling this third product in our existing markets, leveraging our established position to drive sales early and gain market share as the domestic market for product 1 becomes saturated. In year 5, we will begin international sales of the more robust tilt maze in territories where the original product has become established in order to serve customers in those regions who require a more durable product.\"\n         col=\"col-12\"\n         align=\"left\"\n         type=\"text\"\n         font=\"15px\"\n         margin=\"20px 120px 30px 84px\"\n        />\n      </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default JoyStory;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
