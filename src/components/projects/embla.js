Red and pink hues were shown to negatively affect stress perception and increased mental stimulation, whereas blue or green hues had a more calming effect. The disruption of the circadian rhythm is proven to lead to serious physical and mental health problems, including impulsivity, reduced mental flexibility and lower levels of happiness. The sense of smell demonstrates a powerful link between the nose, the limbic system and emotional states. Embla combines all of these to minimise workplace stress by providing localised workplace environments that adapt to the user's stress level.",
